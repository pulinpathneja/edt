## Persona Recommendations

### Solo Traveler
Independent travelers exploring alone

**Key Tips:**
- Like I’m sorry but what the fuck happened to the London rental market? Surely a lot of these have several health and safety violations? Also why is living with black mold now a normalised thing...
- Fearing for their safety, the business withdrew and suspended operations.
- I've noticed social plans are *much* more sporadic because no one has the physical or mental energy to do things anymore (even without kids).

**Things to Avoid:**
- London rentals are dystopian af
- The occupiers demanded money in exchange for leaving (“Give me something and I will go”) and later confronted business representatives while holding cutting tools, warning them not to approach.
- “The cost of clearing blockages and repairing sewers runs into tens of millions of pounds every year, and that money ultimately comes from our customers.”
