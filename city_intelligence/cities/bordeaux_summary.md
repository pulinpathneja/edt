### Food Enthusiast
Travelers focused on culinary experiences

**Key Tips:**
- There was a large Christmas market, though I didn't find that so enjoyable - it was very crowded and it's a fenced-off area (due to security) so it felt a bit strange to me.
- My sister and I (late 20s/early 30s) are heading to France in October and would love itinerary recommendations, especially around restaurants, bars, tours, and fun neighborhoods to wander.
- The Christmas market with antiques was lovely and I loved seeing the sellers at lunchtime putting together their tables and eating lunch giving 0 shits about the clients lol

It's a beautiful city...
